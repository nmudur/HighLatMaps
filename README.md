# HighLatMaps

This repository contains code for Stellar Reddening Based Extinction Maps for Cosmological Applications. The directories are organized as follows:
*  methods_code_Nresol: Code used to generate the maps
*  notebooks_main1/ and notebooks_test/ : Figures and tables.
*  acc_evaluation_lib.py: Code to compute the Angular Cross-Correlation between an input map and reference extragalactic objects. Written by Core F Park.
